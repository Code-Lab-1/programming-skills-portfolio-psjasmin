# Exercise 1: Print Strings
# Write a Python program to print the following string in a specific format.

print("\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star,")
print("    How I wonder what you are!")
print("        Up above the world so high,")
print("        Like a diamond in the sky.")
print("Twinkle, twinkle, little star,")
print("    How I wonder what you are\n") 

# another format to print the string

print("""\nTwinkle, twinkle, little star,
    How I wonder what you are!
        Up above the world so high,
        Like a diamond in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
    How I wonder what you are\n""")
